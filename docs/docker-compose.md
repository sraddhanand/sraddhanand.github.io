Docker compose gives **infrastructure as a code** ability to run the docker orchestration while running the dockerized application in a local workstation or standalone server. Without docker-compose running and managing multiple docker containers in the form of complete application would be tiresome. Moreover, it gives the ability to design and test links between multiple services which can be scaled using container orchestators such as kubernetes.

All the configurations such as volumes, port forwarding, images, container name, dependencies, etc can be written into a yaml file (docker-compose.yaml is the default file) operate the containers using the docker-compose binary.
