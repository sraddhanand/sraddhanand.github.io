## Predictive models
- Supervised model
    - **Regression** : Target variables is continuous
    - **Classification** : Target variables is discreate
- Unsupervised 
    - **Clustering**

## Machine learning life cycle
1. Problem defination 
2. **Hypothesis generation**
List all the possible variables, which might influence the probelm abjective
:::tip
Should be done before looking at the data
:::
3. **Data extraction/collection**
4. [Data exploration/transformation](docs/ml/data-explore): Get insights form the data mostly in table form
5. build model
6.
